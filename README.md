# Data Wrangling

## Introduction
  This is one of the project in Data Analyst Nano degree from Udacity. In this project I have wrangled the data from WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. They have a unique style of rating the dogs in a way that the numerator is always greater than the denominator on a scale of 10. The project used Jupyter notebooks for exection
  
## Steps involved in wrangling
  The wrangling of the dataset was done in three steps namely,
  * Gather
  * Assess
  * Clean
  * Store
  * Analyze
  * Visualise
    
## Gather
  In the 'Gather' step all the required data set is gathered manually or programmatically. In this project, twitter_archive_enhanced.csv given by Udacity which contains twitter archive of WeRateDogs was downloaded manually. The image_prediction.tsv hosted in Udacity's server was downloaded programmatically. Then, some data are queried from the twitter using tweepy package and written into a text file.
